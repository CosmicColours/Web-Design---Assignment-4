    <h4>Concept & Art Direction</h4>
    <p class="info">
        The aesthetics of my project was heavily inspired by fan made lyric video, posted on Youtube, and the different
        eras of online fandom they were made in.
        <br><br>
        The first composition is based on late 2000's, early 2010's videos mostly made in Windows Movie Maker.
        As it was an editing program that was free and available to most people in the early internet.
        <br><br>
        The font I used was the default Arial. I had thought about using Impact font for its
        association with old meme formats, with the top text and bottom text, but I found Arial more
        readable and better for the lyric video aestheticly. I wanted the animations to mimic the built-in 
        transitions in Windows Movie Maker.
        <br><br>
        I used the song "You’re Gonna Go Far, Kid" by The Offspring, as this particular song really captures this era of
        fandom. It was used a lot in fan videos to footage of their favourite media/character.

        <br><br><br>
        The second composition is set around the 2010's era. The videos have a bit more character and colour to them, and editers
        often add pictures of the band/musician into the video with the lyrics they sing. 
        <br><br>
        Boy/Girl bands/groups were also hitting a new peak
        creating more fandom activity among teens and young adults. I added a bit more interactivity to this composition as I think it fit the attitude of the times.
        <br><br>
        There was a lot of cheesy but fun things being made by fans. Not the most well designed as it was mostly made by teens for fun, but passion was definitely there.
        I think having the lyrics do the literal actions of the words would fit the cheesy fun that most things were made in, in this era.
        <br><br>
        I used a nice, sleek, thin font similar to the specific video I referenced. Those were often used in videos, but different
        font may have been used depending on the type of song, musician(s), or fan preferences.

        <br><br><br>
        Finally the last composition is set in the current era of fan made lyric videos. The design a lot more well made
        and has an actual design, instead of just adding in the lyrics and some pictures as it goes. 
        <br><br>
        Coinciding the rise of K-Pop groups and idols, there is a focus on who-sings-what and assigning a colour to certain people.
        The animation is a simple, fun, and fast left to right transition as it fit the more sleek and cute aesthetic for the era.
        <br><br>
        I found a font that had Korean character compatibility as the song I used is from a K-Pop group.
        It has nice round shapes with a bit of a handwritten flare to it, which are characteristic I found in a lot of
        the modern lyric videos. Along with Korean and English translations of the songs lyrics.

        <br><br><br>
        The path through each composition, being through clicking on a link on a particular word associated with the 
        composition it's linking to, is loosely inspired by the idea of the "Riff-off" from the Pitch Perfect movies.
        A simple explination is, people are singing a song, and to transition to a next song someone else must start
        singing a song that is the same word as the last lyric they sang.
        <br><br>
        For example I used "You're" for the first composition to the second.
        <br>
        But for the next compositions it's less literal and more thematic/mood based. 
        <br>
        With "Sledgehammer" going to "Pounding"
        for the second to third. And finally "Attack" felt fitting to transition back to the third back to first
        song as the song is aggressive in nature.
